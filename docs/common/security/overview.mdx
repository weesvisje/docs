Most applications need a way to control which users can write or read certain data. For example, you might build an application where senior staff members can `READ` and `WRITE` documents in the `"menuItems"` collection while junior staff members can only `READ`. Ditto's security is controlled by __identities__. Each Ditto instance must identify itself to other peers in order to syncronize with them. 

 

## Get started

These sections will describe how you can:

1. Identify users 
2. Give users read or write control 
3. Integrate with your existing authentication systems

There are several types of identities.  Every installation of an app that uses
Ditto has its own identity. This identity is used to identify each unique peer
in the mesh network. Each Ditto Identity is associated to a single Ditto client
via a globally unique AppId and may not be used across multiple Ditto apps. Each identity has an `appID`, an authentication certificate, and a set of `permissions`. A Ditto Identity is used
to accept or reject read and writes with peer instances. Each Ditto Identity can
be associated to a set of [access control permissions](../concepts/designing-permissions) which you specify.

### Development identities

When you start prototyping with Ditto you can use a "playground" identity.
Playground identities contain default settings and offer no real security.
Playground certificates should absolutely not be deployed to any production
environments.


* [Online Playground](../mesh-network/online-playground) - for prototyping with Ditto for hybrid/offline online synchornization. Start here!
* [Offline Playground](../mesh-network/offline-license) - a low level of security for applications that never connect to the Internet.


### Production identities

Once you are ready to deploy, this can be swapped for a production identity where security is
enforced.

* [Online With Authentication](../security/authentication/overview) - for hybrid offline/online synchronization with customized permissioning.
* [Shared Key](../security/shared-key) - an intermediate level of security for offline-only applications where all devices are trusted.

### Parts of a Ditto Identity

For more detailed information on what is contained within Ditto Identity certificates, see [Certificate Security](../how-it-works/certificate-security).

## Ditto Identity Lifecycle

While highly configurable, each Ditto Identity has a typical life cycle. First,
the Ditto Identity is constructed. Typically the only prerequisites are a Ditto
persistence root (working directory for local data storage, where configured)
and a globally unique Ditto AppId. In order to sync, all app instances,
regardless of SDK language, *must* have the same globally unique Ditto AppId.
Therefore this value will typically be incorporated in the App's bundle or
provided to the App when it starts. The Ditto Big Peer can create AppIds for
you, but it is not the authentication provider. Ditto Cloud is a proxy to your
own "source of truth" for identities, credential validation, and permissions.

Next the Ditto Identity is consumed by the Ditto constructor, yielding a
configured `Ditto` instance. The Ditto instance will contain a Ditto
Authenticator and your own implementation of the `DittoAuthEventHandler`
interface, which can provide login credentials. Ditto will then contact the
configured Auth Url and supply the login credentials to an Authentication
Provider. If the credentials are valid, then the Authentication Provider will
return to Ditto an Authentication Token, validating its credentials and granting
the Ditto instance individualized permissions. The Ditto instance can now sync
with other peers.
