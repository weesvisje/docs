Most applications need way to control which users can write or read certain data. For example, you might build an application where senior staff members can `READ` and `WRITE` documents in the `"menuItems"` collection while junior staff members can only `READ`. This section will describe how you can:

1. Identify users 
2. Give users read or write control 
3. Integrate with your existing authentication systems

Ditto security is controlled by __identities__. An identity is a combination of a `userID` and a set of `permissions` that identifies how a Ditto instance behaves with other ditto instances. 

There are several types of identities:

* [Online Playground](../concepts/online-playground) - for prototyping with Ditto. Beginners should start here!
* [Online With Authentication](../security/online-with-authentication) - for hybrid offline/online syncronization with customized permissioning.
* [Offline Playground](../mesh-network/offline-license) - a low level of security for applications that never connect to the Internet.
* [Shared Key](../security/shared-key) - an intermediate level of security for applications where all devices are trusted.
* [Manual](../how-it-works/certificate-security) - flexible security policies with higher complexity.

There are other identities geared towards peer-to-peer only scenarios. [You can read more about them here.](../mesh-network/identities)
