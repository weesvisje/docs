:::info
This section contains an advanced discussion of Ditto's underlying certificate, identity, and
encryption implementation. Most readers can skip this section.  However, if you are deploying an enterprise
on-premises deployment of Ditto, you may be required to reference the following
material.  
:::

All communications are consistently protected by modern and robust encryption
for all of Ditto's communication methods. Cryptographically-signed business
rules ensure users can only sync data that they are permitted to access. The app
developer is in complete control of the keys, certificates, and rules.

The Ditto Big Peer provisions a signed x509 certificate. This certificate may
then be presented to other Ditto peers to mutually establish trust and create
encrypted communications channels. 
 
The following details information about the certificates used to encrypt the
communication channels.

## Identities

An identity is a bundle of the device and app-specific information:

* Site ID - A number unique to this device.
* App Name - A name identifying the application. This avoids different Ditto-enabled apps trying to sync with each other. These are unique identifiers, for example, `5322afcd-5a70-43a3-bc2d-85d98ccf5ac0`
* Access Rules - Define which documents this device is allowed to read or write during sync.
* Private Key - A secret for authenticating as this identity.
* Identity Certificate - A certificate verifying the particulars of this device, signed by the CA.
* CA Certificate - Used to verify certificates presented by other devices with the same app.

## Certificates

Ditto identities and public keys are distributed in the standard X.509
certificate format. They do not directly contain potentially sensitive data such as access rules,
but these can be defined by the app's authentication webhook with the 
[OnlineWithAuthentication identity](../security/designing-permissions), or by the
developer through the `Manual` identity.
 
When you are ready to use production identities, feel free to contact
us through the Ditto Portal and we will help you set up the right CA
tooling for your use case - or provide specifications so you can build your own.


## Discovering peers

Devices need to have the same AppID to discover other peers on the network, as
well as matching certificates to connect over TLS 1.3. Peer-to-peer connections use mTLS (client certificates) with TLS 1.3. Connections to the Big Peer use a TLS-secured WebSocket connection, with authentication by JWT. Once the certificates match,
then the embedded authorization information inside each certificate is used to
authorize any incoming requests by that peer. This ensures that those access
control rules are enforced. 
 
## Synchronizing with the Big Peer

:::info
The description below covers internal details of the Big Peer implementation.  Ditto’s authentication module handles this
implementation for you under the hood as part of the `OnlineWithAuthentication` and `OnlinePlayground`
identities. 
:::

### Overview

Online Authentication can be used when a Ditto application is hosted on a Big Peer. The Big Peer hosts an HTTPS identity service, which handles login requests. In Online Authentication mode, a Small Peer must log in with credentials before it can communicate with any peers. The login flow populates the Small Peer with valid authentication material that identifies the user and defines their level of access. Once the Small Peer receives this data after a successful login, the transports which depend on it will start automatically.

###  Step 1: Complete a Peer Key Challenge

The peer’s public key will be included in the certificates returned by the identity service. The identity service needs proof that the authenticating Small Peer actually holds the corresponding private key.

1. Small Peer downloads a challenge token from `/_ditto/auth/cert` - this is a time-limited JWT which the client treats as opaque data.
2. Small Peer uses their Peer Key to sign it with the context `LoginKeyVerification`.

### Step 2: Log in with Credentials

When a client attempts to authenticate, it will make an HTTPS request to the identity service containing the following payload:

- Signed challenge,
- App ID,
- Provider name, and
- Credentials to be forwarded to the app's [authentication webhook](../security/online-with-authentication).

Once the identity service has a response from the auth webhook, it will build and sign a JWT. In addition to the information we would expect to find in a JWT (issuer, issued at, expiry, etc), we also include an encoded representation of the Ditto Identity.
The Ditto Identity is built from the information provided by the app's authentication webhook response.

### Step 3: Upgrade to an X.509 Certificate

Once a peer has a JWT, it will want to use this to get a device certificate.  The
peer will now make an HTTPS certificate request to the identity service.
The “request certificate” endpoint requires a valid JWT.  The contents of the
new certificate is closely tied to the JWT.  The certificate expiration time is the same as the JWT, and the ditto identity embedded in the
certificate is pulled from the JWT.  The identity service generates a
private key for the device.  It uses this private key to generate a CSR on
behalf of the client and then the identity service’s CA keys to sign it.

Once this information is prepared, the identity service is ready to respond to the request.
The response will include the client's generated certificate and private key, a list of CA certificates the client should trust, and a DateTime for
expiration. The client will persist the JWT, device private key, device
certificate, and CA certificates on disk and only update them when they get near
expiration.

When two peers authenticate with each other, they can use either
the JWT or the device certificate via MTLS. The decision depends on the client's
capabilities and connection type.

**Why does X.509 return both a key and a certificate instead of locally generating a key and sending a CSR?**

It would be possible to use a standard CSR flow. It was chosen to issue keys directly for a few reasons.

- There is no security benefit as our certificate request is in a secured tunnel, and the identity service is presumed to be completely trustworthy.
- Validating and signing CSRs is more complex than simply creating one with the correct format and fields.
- This is a convenient workflow if using Hashicorp Vault or similar to manage your PKI and issue certificates on demand.

**Why is X.509 a separate request?**

The idea is that JWTs could be quite short-lived but the X.509 certs could be long-lived to permit long periods of working offline, so the Small Peer could call them to refresh at different intervals. Different expiry periods between JWT and X.509 isn’t implemented yet.

Additionally, browser peers have no use for X.509 certificates so they don’t request them.

Of course, the Small Peer could have a single request that lets you request some combination of identities at once. There is no reason this couldn’t be added in the future to reduce latency.
