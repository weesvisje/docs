:::info
To sync data entirely offline without ever synchronizing with the Big Peer, you
will have to request an offline-only license. 

Most applications should instead use [Online With Authentication](../security/authentication/overview) or [Online Playground](../mesh-network/online-playground).
:::

Offline license tokens are required to use [OfflinePlayground](../mesh-network/offline-license#offline-playground),
[Manual](../how-it-works/certificate-security), and
[SharedKey](../security/shared-key) identities.

## Request a license 

To request a license, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the
__Offline License Tokens__ section. Press the **Request offline license** button
to get started. Your license request will be sent to a Ditto engineer and we
will soon contact you in order to generate an offline license for your app. Your
license will appear here once it has been generated.

Playground or Online with Authentication.
