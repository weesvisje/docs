:::info
This guide is for syncronizing data entirely offline without ever synchronizing without ever connecting to the Big Peer.

Most applications should instead use [Online With Authentication](../security/authentication/overview) or [Online Playground](../mesh-network/online-playground).
:::

Offline license tokens are required to use [OfflinePlayground](../mesh-network/offline-license#offline-playground),
[Manual](../how-it-works/certificate-security), and
[SharedKey](../security/shared-key) identities.

## Request a license 

To request a license, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the
__Offline License Tokens__ section.

## Offline Playground

:::caution
Devices using Offline Playground **will not synchronize** with devices using Online
Playground or Online with Authentication.  
:::

Offline Playground are suitable for testing offline-only behavior.

* Apps with Offline Playground can read and write to all collections.
* Apps with Offline Playground will connect to other peer devices with the __same appID__ and __offlineOnlyLicenseToken__.
* Apps with Offline Playground will not synchronize with the Big Peer.
