# Troubleshooting

## Ditto won't sync

If you are having trouble syncronizing devices in Ditto, follow this guide.

### Initial diagnostics

1. Set `DittoLogger.minimumLogLevel = DittoLogLevel.VERBOSE` before you initialize `Ditto(identity)`.
1. Look at the logs. Do you see any helpful errors or warnings?
1. Verify that your app id is the same on all devices

### Bluetooth is not working

1. Turn Use Location on
1. Turn Bluetooth Scanning on
1. Are permisisons set correctly? See [installation](./installation).
1. Go to your OS-level permissions for Bluetooth and clear the app permissions for your application.
1. Delete the app, install it again, and open it. Does it ask for Bluetooth permissions?
1. Android only: are you calling `ditto?.refreshPermissions()`

### LAN is not working

1. Are both devices connected to the same WiFi network?
1. Check your router settings and see the [LAN troubleshooting guide](./mesh-network/supported-transports/#local-area-network).

### Online Playground 

#### Is your playground token copied correctly? 

1. Login to the [Portal](https://portal.ditto.live) 
1. Go to your App.
1. Make sure that the portal playground token is the same as the value you are using in your code.

#### Did your device connect to the internet?

`OnlinePlayground` applications must connect to the Big Peer first
*before* going offline. [Read more about online playground](./mesh-network/online-playground).

If your app need full offline access without ever connecting to the Internet, please
request an [offline license token](./mesh-network/offline-license).

### Offline Playground and Shared Key

1. Login to the [Ditto Portal](https://portal.ditto.live).
1. Check the value of your offline license token in the Ditto Portal. Is the offline license token expired?
1. Is the offline license token copied correctly?
1. Is the shared key copied correctly? [Generate a new shared key.](./security/shared-key)
